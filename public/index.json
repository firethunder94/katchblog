As Ethnology is not well-known, I’d like to write about it and bring the subject a bit more into the public. Additionally, you find some posts about my life. So, enjoy reading what I have to tell the world.","keywords":null,"title":"Katch Blog","uri":"/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Katching Up With Travelling","uri":"/categories/katching-up-with-travelling/"},{"categories":["Katching Up With Travelling"],"content":"Sooo, Thailand! I’ve spent three weeks in the home country of my aunt (she is Thai and moved to Switzerland when she married my uncle), not with her, but with three friends. We’ve been backpacking during summer, which means off-season. That gave us the chance to decide spontaneously where to go and what to do instead of planning everything in advance. Nevertheless we had some things we wanted to do like seeing elephants, going on a trek and relaxing at the beaches. We managed to do all of that and way more during our trip.\n","keywords":null,"title":"Thailand, in summer 2016","uri":"/thailand/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Travels","uri":"/travels/"},{"categories":["Katching Up With Ethnology"],"content":"You think, Ethnology is something new? Far wrong. Although it hasn’t been institutionalised until the end of the 19th century and still is a small chair, the interest in other peoples existed long before and people always wrote about other cultures. How ethnology has developed, you can find out here.\n","keywords":null,"title":"A Brief History of Ethnology","uri":"/history/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Ethnologies","uri":"/ethnology/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Katching Up With Ethnology","uri":"/categories/katching-up-with-ethnology/"},{"categories":["Katching Up With Travelling"],"content":"Morocco has been on my To-Do-List for quite a while.

I love being on the road, meeting new people, immersing myself in a completely different world. Tasting food I’ve never heard of, feeling the vibe of a buzzing city or relaxing on a lonely beach. I love the adventures, living just for the moment without knowing what to expect next and being open for whatever might come. I love the liberty and the expansion of the horizon that comes with travelling.\n","keywords":null,"title":"Katching Up With Travelling","uri":"/katchingtravelling/"},{"categories":["Katching Up With Ethnology"],"content":"When I told my friends and family that I’m going to study Ethnology, everyone was like: “Oh nice. Sounds great. But… what is Ethnology exactly?” I don’t blame them for this reaction, I didn’t know what Ethnology is either before I discovered it on the university website. Ethnology isn’t present in peoples heads, although our behaviour is closely related with it. Ethnology isn’t present in the public, although we are confronted with it in everydays life. And Ethnology isn’t present in politics, although it is very important in the globalised world we’re living in.\nSo, what is Ethnology? With this blog, I’d like to bring Ethnology closer to the people. And in this first blogpost, I’d like to give a first impression of it.\n","keywords":null,"title":"Katching Up With Ethnology","uri":"/katchingethnology/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Katching Up With Katja","uri":"/categories/katching-up-with-katja/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Katjas","uri":"/katja/"},{"categories":["Katching Up With Katja"],"content":"I wasn’t sure about starting blogging.

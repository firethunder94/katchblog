      <description>&lt;p&gt;You think, Ethnology is something new? Far wrong. Although it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been institutionalised until the end of the 19th century and still is a small chair, the interest in other peoples existed long before and people always wrote about other cultures. How ethnology has developed, you can find out here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I told my friends and family that I&amp;rsquo;m going to study Ethnology, everyone was like: &amp;ldquo;Oh nice. Sounds great. But&amp;hellip; what is Ethnology exactly?&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t blame them for this reaction, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what Ethnology is either before I discovered it on the university website. Ethnology isn&amp;rsquo;t present in peoples heads, although our behaviour is closely related with it. Ethnology isn&amp;rsquo;t present in the public, although we are confronted with it in everydays life. And Ethnology isn&amp;rsquo;t present in politics, although it is very important in the globalised world we&amp;rsquo;re living in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is Ethnology? With this blog, I&amp;rsquo;d like to bring Ethnology closer to the people. And in this first blogpost, I&amp;rsquo;d like to give a first impression of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

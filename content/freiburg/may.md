I have been living now about half a year in Freiburg and I really fell in love with the city. So I thought it would be nice to tell you a little bit about my favourite things to do here. I started this new category Freiburg around the year where you find every month a post about what I liked to do most the past few weeks. And for May it is... (drum roll)... Strawberry picking!

Strawberries are my favourite fruit and every spring I long for the strawberry season. Instead of just buying them in a market, my boyfriend and I decided to pick them ourselves. We've been four times so far and probably continue in June. There are so many strawberry fields around the city, I'm sure there is one around the corner where you live. We've been to different fields, but now stick to an organic field, the Naturgut HÃ¶rnle in Schallstadt.

It is very easy to pick strawberries by yourself. Just bring a huge bowl (or maybe even more than one) with you, weigh it at the cashier and go to the field. Take your time, enjoy the sun and the strawberries and fill your bowls. If you've finished, you go back and pay per kilo.

I hope I could inspire you a little bit. What was your favourite thing to do in May? Tell me in the comments!

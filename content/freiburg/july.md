In July it's quite hot in Freiburg, and as you know already the best spots for swimming, I want to share another fun activity to cool down: hiking. Hiking? Isn't it way too hot for hiking?, you might ask. And yes, it seems like that, but in the forest the temperature is actually cooler than in the city.

The most famous hiking spot around Freiburg is the Schlossberg. I've been up there several times, or better said: Everytime I had friends or family visiting me. That's just a must-do with people visiting Freiburg. Hiking up, enjoying the great view on Freiburg and then on the way down you can have a cold beverage in the Kastanienhof, or rest a little bit in the Stadtgarten.

Another nice hike goes to the Kybfelsen. That's the hill on the other side of Freiburg. You can start at the train station Wiehre and discover the hill. I've been there several times and still don't know all of the paths going up the hill. What I want to say: You can rediscover the hill everytime you go there. The nice thing about that hill is that it has a barbecue place in the direction to Schauinsland, and the Waldsee on the other side. So you can choose how you want to end your hike: With a barbeque or rather relaxing at the lake?

Nearby to where I live is the Schönberg. It's a short hike and perfect if you want to start the day with walking. Or if you want to see the sunset in the evening. Just next to the Schönberg is a ruin called Schneeburg. Some of the walls of the old castle are still standing and it's just a nice place to be.

Lately, I've been on the Schauinsland. You can reach the top of the hill with a cable car, but we decided to walk from the valley station. On the way uphill you have a nice view already, but the tower on the Schauinsland is the best spot. You can see everything, from Freiburg to the Schwarzwald and the Vosgues in France. From the top we walked back to Freiburg, there's a very nice path along the mountain ridge leading to the train station Wiehre. I can only recommend you to do this hike whenever you have time!

One of the hikes on my to-do-list is the Kandel. It's a little bit further, but still reachable by bike. Let's see, when I can go there! Of course there are way more hiking trips in the Schwarzwald, especially when you go somewhere by train and start there. So, go to the Schwarzwald and enjoy the nature around Freiburg!

This month it definitely got warmer and what is better than a swim in the cold water on a hot day? I like cities with water, it doesn't matter if it is a river flowing through the city or if the city is built on a lake. So, lucky me that I'm living in Freiburg, where there are several lakes and a river!

<!--more-->

Let's begin with the river Dreisam. It flows through all of Freiburg and you're never far from it. Along the river you can sit, walk, cycle and more and of course you can go into the water to cool down. Swimming is difficult but hey, there are lakes for that.

I'm pretty sure you have heard of the Flückigersee, better known as just Seepark. You can find students at every hour during the day there as a lot of student dorms are next to it. So there's always something going on. It's perfect to jump from the bridge in the middle of the water and probably someone is trying to balance on a waterline. If you are not a waterperson, you can sunbathe in the grass, walk around the lake or get an ice cream in the cafeteria.
 
Another great thing: Right now the trees are demonstrating against climate change. Some people really put a lot of effort into it, so the trees are holding protest signs with slogans about climate change. Check it out and see why it is important to demonstrate for #BäumeForFuture.

My favourite lake is the Dietenbachsee. It is pretty close to where I live that's why we spent several hours studying under a tree at the bank of the lake or chilling there in the evening. The lake is small and cute, you can walk around it in 15 minutes. Next to the lake is a volleyball field where you always find someone to play with and most of the time there are slackliners present too. Around the lake there are even more opportunities to do sports: a skatepark, a bikepark, a parkour spot, a playground and frisbee-golf.

The last lake I'd like to mention here (although there are several more) is the Opfingersee. It is a little bit outside of Freiburg but still reachable by bike. Situated in the forest this lake is a popular place to spend the weekend. Between the parking lot and the lake is a grassland where people chill and grill. From this side the water is shallow and kids are playing in the lake. Next to the lake is a small house with a cafeteria as well as toilets. If you can't find a place on the grassland, just start walking along the lake. It's a nice walk along the forest path and here and there you can find a place to sit next to the lake.

Those are my favourite waters in Freiburg, although there are more. For example the Moosweiher is nice as well, or if you'd like to go a little bit further there is the Rimsingersee or the Titisee. As I said already, I love waters and I'm glad I can spend a lot of my time at the bank of a lake.

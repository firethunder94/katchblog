When I told my friends and family that I wanted to study Ethnology, everyone was like "Yeah nice. Sounds great. But... what is Ethnology exactly?" I don't blame them for that, I didn't know what Ethnology is either before I discovered it on the university website. Ethnology isn't present in peoples heads, although our behaviour is closely related with it. Ethnology isn't present in the public, although we are confronted with it in everydays life. And Ethnology isn't present in politics, although it is very important in the globalized world. 

So, what is Ethnology? In this blogpost I'd like to give a first impression of it.

Have you ever heard of colonization? Of course you have. Have you ever heard of its impacts? Of course you have, for example the momvent "Black Lives Matter". And have you ever heard of decolonisation? That former colonized parts of the world want justice for the political and economic violence? Probably you have. But the root of it is the epistemic violence, violence of our thoughts. The root of it is where we build our thoughts, and that's often in universities.

Former colonized nations are confronted by three kinds of violences: Political violence, economic violence and epistemic violence. Political violence is closely related to the history of state formation, how settlers managed that natives became foreigners and foreigners natives. Economic violence is the reason for the high inequality in the world. It's the most present one of the three violences right now. One violence not yet in our mind is the epistemic violence. It is about thought  and the political and economic effects of that thought. This means that if we want justice for political and economic violence, we firstly need justice for epistemic violence. But how can we achieve that?

I have no answer to this question, if I had, I would be holding speeches in front of the whole world. But I can give you a little insight on how colonized our system still is and share some of my thoughts with you.

Worldwide, the education is based on Eurocentric values. But why? Why is it a good thing to go after high school into a counrty of the Global South and teach the children from a village English? Why is it important that those children learn with a European curriculum instead of learning the histroy and knowledge of the counrty? Why is it impossible for them to achieve anything, if they don't follow the european way? 

> "A Eurocentric canon is a canon that attributes truth only to the Western way of knowledge production. It is a canon that disregards other epistemic traditions. It is a canon that tries to portray colonialism as a normal form of social relations between human beings rather than a system of exploitation and oppression." (Mbembe, 2016)

This quote of a cameroon historian touch on a lot of things. I start at the end: Colonialism is seen as a normal form of social relation between human beings. And it is true. It is still normal that we profit on the exploitation of ill-paid workers who sew our clothes, who cultivate our bananas, who live a poor life so that we can keep our luxurious life. It is still normal that People of Colour are oppressed and have lower chances to study in a university. 

The Eurocentric canon disregards other epistemic traditions than the European one. It says that we Europeans know how to live life and that everyone has to live it our way. Or as Pillay (2015) said: "It [Eurocentric worldview] centers the idea of Europe, as a metaphor, and turns all others into bit players or loiterers without intent on the stage of world history, either too lazy to do anything ourselves or always late, and running behind to catch up with Western modernity." We don't even give them a chance, and that's leading me to two other points.

The first one is related to the quote of Mbembe and is about the knowledge production. There is one way to produce knowledge, and that is the Western way. Every other way is disregarded, although there has been Afican universities long before European universities have been established. But why do we only accept the Western way of generating knowledge? Isn't there another way of the same, if not of greater value? 

The second point is that People of Colour often don't have voice. We don't cherish their thoughts, their matter isn't important for us. And at the same time we expect that our matter have to be their matter as well. How can we change education and knowledge production so that People of Colour have the same opportunities? That they not only have the right to speak and tell their truths, but also are able to make use of this right?

Our aim should be to create a world full of different voices. To overcome the postcolonial world we have today and to build up a universal world where the diversity is cherished and not oppressed. And as Mbembe said: "To reopen the future of our planet to all who inhabit it, we will have to learn how to share it again amongst the humans, but also between the humans and the non-humans."
